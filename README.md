# Emoji-Picker

Fork of fdw's rofimoji script, including a script with kaomoji (list courtesy of [Longhinus](https://github.com/Longhinus/rofimoji)) and one with unicode glyphs. Bind all three to separate keys and you will have all the reacts you need for the rest of your life, right at your fingertips.

See the [original](https://github.com/fdw/rofimoji) rofimoji repo for installation&update instructions.
